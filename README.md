# Segmentation_Evaluation

This repository provides Python code for the metric SSEGEP to evaluate the segmentation performance. It emphasizes the segmentation of smaller segments more compared to larger ones. This is important in medical scenarios where the segmentation of smaller segments is crucial as in tumor segmentation or exudate segmentation. This is done by assigning a higher weightage to smaller segments, thereby penalizing the loss of smaller segments more compared to larger ones.
